# Contributing to Land of the Rair

Want to contribute to the game? Awesome. There are a couple of ways you can contribute:

* Code
* Content (NPCs, Items, Recipes)
* Maps

Contributions will almost certainly net you some in-game Silver (no promises can be made, but it will probably happen). 

## Before Starting

Before you start any work, _please_ make reach out to a developer and make sure your idea fits in with the project. No one wants to do work that won't get accepted!

## Code

To contribute code, I would urge you to set up and run the game locally ([instructions here](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/lotr2/blob/master/README.md#requirements)). This will allow you to actually test your changes. When submitting code, you will have to create a pull request. If your pull request is sufficiently large (tackling a big fix, feature, etc) please describe it in-depth on the pull request. Some examples of what code changes could be:

* Increasing a spawner's density, or creating a new one.
* Creating a new NPC type.
* Adjusting AI behavior.
* Creating a new spell.
* Creating a new quest.

Please note that tests are automatically run when you create a pull request. Your code must pass these tests to be considered.

## Content

To contribute content, you don't _really_ need to have a local instance of the game running, since the content is just a plain text file, which can be edited without really testing. Some things you can change:

* Creating or editing items
* Creating or editing npcs
* Creating or editing recipes

Please note that these are _also_ tested when a pull request is submitted.

## Maps

 The best way for a player to contribute to the game is by creating maps! I've [written a guide on getting started with map making](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/lotr2/wiki/Map-Creation), which details the process from start to finish for creating a map. You will receive silver for your effort, in addition. You can see some map ideas [on this page](https://github.com/LandOfTheRair/landoftherair/wiki/Possible-New-Maps), which lists, in detail, where they are, what they would contain, the general player level, and also the reward for completing that particular map. You do not have to follow this list, either! If you have a great idea, talk to me about it.
